# Blockchain-based Continuous Integration Prototype

This is an ongoing project for my thesis. This prototype aims to record CI outputs to a blockchain to protect the integrity of the build logs or results generated by CI systems.

# Active branches I am working on
dev: bbci prototype (used intkey as model) \

# Inactive branches
feature-1: bbci prototype (used intkey as model) \
feature-2: bci prototype (used xo as model)

# Usage
Clone the BBCI-prototype repository, then make sure that you have the docker engine and docker-compose installed on your machine.

To run the application, navigate to the project's root directory, then use this command:
    <blockquote>
        <p>docker-compose up</p>
    </blockquote>

This command starts all BBCI components in separate containers.
